# random-pokemon
Generates a list of random pokemon, either automatically or through a one-person draft.

For a draft, do:
`python random_poke.py draft` or `python random_poke.py d`

For just a random list, do:
`python random_poke.py random` or `python random_poke.py r`

By default, the program generates either 18 random pokemon, or a draft with 8 rounds and 4 options per  round. Change these by modifying the constants in `random_poke.py`.
